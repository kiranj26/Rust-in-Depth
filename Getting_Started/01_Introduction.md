# Introduction to Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segmentation faults, and guarantees thread safety. It is designed to be safe, concurrent, and performant while maintaining a modern and ergonomic syntax.

## Key Features of Rust
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system eliminates null pointer dereferences and dangling pointers.
- **Performance**: Comparable to C and C++.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in tools to handle multithreading safely and efficiently.
- **Modern Toolchain**: Includes Cargo (package manager) and rustfmt (formatter).

Rust is ideal for:
- Embedded systems
- WebAssembly
- Command-line tools
- High-performance applications

## Why Learn Rust?
1. **Safety without Garbage Collection**: Rust ensures memory safety while avoiding the overhead of garbage collection.
2. **Active Community**: A rapidly growing community with excellent resources and libraries.
3. **Versatility**: Suitable for low-level programming and high-level abstractions.
